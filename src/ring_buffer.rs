//! Lock-free ring buffer implementation for single-producer, single-consumer scenarios.
//!
//! This module provides a high-performance, lock-free ring buffer optimized for audio
//! processing applications where one thread produces data and another consumes it.

/// A lock-free ring buffer for single-producer, single-consumer (SPSC) scenarios.
///
/// This ring buffer is optimized for audio processing where samples need to be written
/// by one thread (typically an interrupt handler) and read by another (typically the
/// main processing loop).
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This implementation is **only safe** when used with exactly one producer thread
/// and one consumer thread. Using multiple producers or consumers will result in
/// undefined behavior.
///
/// # Generic Parameters
///
/// * `N` - The buffer capacity. **Must be a power of two** for efficient modulo operations
///   using bit masking (e.g., 1024, 2048, 4096).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// let buffer: RingBuffer<1024> = RingBuffer::new();
///
/// // Producer thread
/// buffer.push(0.5);
/// buffer.push(-0.3);
///
/// // Consumer thread
/// let sample1 = buffer.pop(); // 0.5
/// let sample2 = buffer.pop(); // -0.3
/// ```
pub struct RingBuffer<const N: usize> {
    /// The actual buffer storage. UnsafeCell allows interior mutability.
    buf: UnsafeCell<[f32; N]>,
    /// Atomic write index (producer position)
    write: AtomicU32,
    /// Atomic read index (consumer position)
    read: AtomicU32,
}

// Safety â€“ single producer / single consumer.
